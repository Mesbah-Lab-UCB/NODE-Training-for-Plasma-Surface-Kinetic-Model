This folder contains ensemble average MD data at different ion fluence and ion energy conditions for Si RIE with F and Ar. 
The MD data is generated using a C++ code from the Graves group. 
The data has been preprocessed, to calculate occupation numbers of different states of F at different times
Each file is a .csv file which contains tabular time series data. 
The states are differentiated using the coordination number of F, with Cl<=1 implying F at surface, F in mixed layer otherwise.
Three realizations of each condition was taken and then added to take the ensemble average.
Training Data was generated for fluence between 500 and 1000, intervals of 25, and for energy between 20eV to 80eV in intervals of 2eV
Flux ratio of F to Ar was kept constant throughout as 5.
